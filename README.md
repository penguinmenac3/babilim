# Babilim

> An attepmt to make a keras like framework for pytorch and tensorflow.


Please visit the [Documentation](https://penguinmenac3.github.io/babilim/index.html) if you just want to use babilim.

## Install

Follow the official instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install pytorch or [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) to install tensorflow 2.

```

## What is Babilim?

Babilim is a Deep Learning Framework designed for ease of use like Keras.
The API is designed to be intuitive and easy while allowing for complex production or research models.
On top of that babilim runs on top of Tensorflow 2 or Pytorch, whichever you prefer.

Babilim was designed for:

* Intuitive ease of use,
* a unified development experience across pytorch and tf2,
* flexibility for research and robustness for production

Install Babilim
===============

Using *conda or virtualenv is highly recommended* if you do not already use them.

**1. Install your backend**

Follow the official instructions `here (pytorch) <https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>`_ or `here (tf2) <https://www.tensorflow.org/install>`_.
If you don't know which one to choose, roll a dice, it does not matter for this framework.

**2. Install babilim**

.. code-block:: bash

    # Stable Version
    pip install babilim

    # Bleeding Edge
    pip install git+https://github.com/penguinmenac3/babilim.git

Done it is as easy as that.
Maybe try out one of our examples next?
See the list of examples on the left.

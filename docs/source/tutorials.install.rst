Using *conda or virtualenv is highly recommended* if you do not already use them.

**1. Install your backend**

Follow the official instructions `here <https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>`_ to install pytorch or `here <https://www.tensorflow.org/install>`_ to install tensorflow 2.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Stable Version
    pip install babilim

    # Bleeding Edge
